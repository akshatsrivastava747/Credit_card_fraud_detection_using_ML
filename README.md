Credit card fraud detection using ML models
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to build a machine learning system that can automatically identify fraudulent transactions. With the rapid growth of online payments, fraud has become a serious issue for banks and customers. This project analyzes transaction data and uses classification algorithms to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent activities.

The system is trained on historical transaction datasets, where each transaction is labeled as fraud (1) or non-fraud (0). Key steps include data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, feature engineering, and model training. Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks are applied and compared to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

By detecting suspicious activities in real time, the project helps financial institutions reduce financial losses, improve customer trust, and strengthen security in digital transactions.
